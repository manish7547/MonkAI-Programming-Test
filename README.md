# BankNote_Authentication

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens.
For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. 
The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained.
Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

Problem to solve : To Predict whether the note is genuine or not

#  Iris Flower Dataset
Iris flower data set used for multi-class classification.
Description:

### Context
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines

### content
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).

This dataset is free and is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository

# Handwritten Digit Recognition(MNIST)

## Introduction
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “Hello World” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, we aim to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. Kaggle has curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. They hope to encourage us to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.
